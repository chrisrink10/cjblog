This is my home-built blog and home page. It is written using Python, Flask,
SQLAlchemy, and a few other smaller packages.

## Getting Started

Before you create your site, you'll need to generate your database,
administrator user, and config file:

    make setup

You can easily start your new blog using Docker and Docker Compose:

    make start

To start a development server, simply use:

    make dev-server
